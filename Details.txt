Topics:
  
  class vs id
  priority
  use of important
  display property: inline, block, inline-block
  box model: padding,margin,border

  parent inherit:
    inheriting the property value from the parent is called parent inherit

  gradient:
    linear-gradient --> linear mixing of colors
    radial-gradient --> radial mixing of colors

  css function:
    url() --> takes a path for the image or someother
    linear-gradient() --> 
    calc() --> calculate the property value from arthimetic operation (-, +)
    eg: width: calc(100px - 30px) ---> 70px
        parent entire width is 1000px 
        width: calc(100% - 50px) ---> 950px

  Position:

    Positioning an element inside document with help of CSS properties

    top, left, right, bottom

    static/initial:
      1. Goes with the normal flow of the document
      2. Occupies its own space in the document
      3. Not affected by top, right, bottom, left values
      4. Affected by scrolling
    
    Relative:
      1. Goes witht the normal flow of the document
      2. Occupies its own space in the document
      3. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respect to its postion initial position also will overlap other elements if itercepted
      4. Affected by scrolling

    Absolute:
      1. Removed from the normal flow of the document and made to appear float over normal flow
         of the document
      2. No Space is occupied in the in the normal flow of the document or page layout
      3. when **no** top, right ... props are specified itstays in 0px top respective to its initial position
      4. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respective to initial 
          containing block (html tag) ** provided none of its parents/ancestors has non 
          static position value**
        ** When some of its parents has non static position value then it moves with 
        respective to the closest non static positioned parent **
      5. Affected by scrolling
    
    Fixed:
      1. Removed from the normal flow of the document and made to appear float over normal flow
         of the document
      2. No Space is occupied in the page layout
      3. Affected by top, right, bottom, left values with respective to initial

    z-index:
      z-index is like floor value which decides what element should appear above other elements
    
  Overflow: (overflow-x, overflow-y)
    visible: overflow will be visible and would hide the parent ( default value)
    hidden: hides the overflowing content
    auto/overlay: adds horizontal / vertical whenever the contents is overflowing
    scroll: irrespective of overflow adds a scroll bar permanently
  
  Text-Overflow: 
    clip --> clips the extra lines
    elipsis ...

  display: none; will be visible in html elements
  will not be rendered in document

  visibility: hidden; element will be rendered with its own space in the document but will be hidden to the user. Still it occupies the space
  
  measurements / Units:
    Absolute Unit: 
    px - pixel, pt - point, pc - picas
    1px = 1/96th of an inch

    1pt = point 1/72th of an inch

    1pc = picas,  12 * 1pt or 1/6th of inch

    Relative Units ( changes relative to its parent ) :
      %, vh, vw, 
      1% -> 1 percent of the parent's property value

      vw -> viewport width
        1vw -> 1 % viewport width
      vh -> viewport height
        1vh -> 1 % viewport height
   

Next Session:
  empherical Units:
    1em --> 1 * fontsize of parent 
    2rem --> 2 * fontsize of parent 

    1rem --> 1 * fontsize of root/initial containing element
    2rem --> 2 * fontsize of root/initial containing element
